				About Me
				</div>
				I am currently a Sophomore in Computer Engineering at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. I am interested in web development and software programming. I have experience working with Java, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, jQuery, Enterprise Architect, Arduinos and circuits. I am currently learning C and UNIX command line.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the past, I have created functional websites that implement Google Maps API, bootstrap, and are responsive. I have worked with individuals in the prelimary stages of creating functioning programs for clients, including documentations.
				<br>
				<br>
				I was born in Skokie, Illinois and moved to Mount Prospect, IL and have resided there ever since. Prior to attending UIUC, I was a student at <a href="http://phs.d214.org/">Prospect High School</a> in Mount Prospect, IL.
				<br>
				<br>
				I chose to attend UIUC because of the high-achieving engineering program and the opportunities the university would supply me with; I knew these would make me a well-rounded person and that I would be able to hone any talents and shape them into ambitions that would drive me to succeed. For instance, the number of opportunities the Engineering Career Service provides engineering students with in order to develop skills on how to speak with professionals is astounding and there are plenty of classes which help students determine what branch of Computer Engineering they would like to delve into.
				Through classes such as<a href="http://www.ece.illinois.edu/mediacenter/article.asp?id=1150" target="_blank">ENG 100</a>,<a href="http://www.ece.illinois.edu/courses/description.asp?num=110" target="_blank">ECE 110</a> and<a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/courses/profile/CS125" target="_blank">CS 125</a>, I have been able to better discover my niche in Computer Engineering.
